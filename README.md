## Player and Team

I made this as a practice for myself and a resource for fellow Turing students.
Solutions are included in the file to reference but I would try to work through it on your own first! It's modeled after our mock assessment but I would say is longer than those files. So don't feel like it HAS to be done in 20 minutes.

I don't know how to structure test files yet so I took an existing Turing practice repo and changed all the files, names, and tests.

## Steps for Installation

```
1. Clone down repo.
2. `cd` into `player-team-test`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm test player-test.js`
```

## Work Time

First, pass all tests for the Player, and then all of the tests for Team.
